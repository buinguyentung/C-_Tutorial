The first C++ project to build a blockchain.
There are 2 main classes: Block and Blockchain
+ Block:
Private: _nIndex, _nNonce, _sData, _sHash, _tTime, _CalculateHash()
Public: constructor, sPrevHash, GetHash(), MineBlock(), GetIndex(), GetNonce(), GetData(), GetTime()

+ Blockchain:
Private: _nDifficulty, _vChain, _GetLastBlock()
Public: constructor, AddBlock(), PrintLastBlockInfo()

And, we are going to use the SHA256 hashing technique to create hashes of our blocks.
